**Why these questions work:**

Think of your survey like a doctor's diagnostic questionnaire—it's not just gathering information, it's also educating the patient about symptoms they might not have realized were problems. Questions 2-3 make people *feel* their pain points. Questions 6-7 validate your roadmap while making them envision using your solution. Question 10 anchors pricing expectations early.

The open-ended question (#11) is your gold mine—you'll discover use cases and messaging angles you hadn't considered. Some respondent might say "I'd love if it remembered my writing voice for each platform" and boom—that's a feature idea *and* marketing copy.
